            <p>Hello there! My name is Brock Delebreau. I’m a user experience architect, interface designer, and all-around geeky guy currently working on my third-year at Michigan State University. While I’m majoring in Experience Architecture (more on that in a bit), I’m also studying LGBTQ and Sexuality Studies. I love working with technology to generate new opportunities across a variety of mediums and fields for people of all skills and abilities.</p>

            <p>I’m a third-year student at Michigan State in East Lansing, Michigan. Experience Architecture is a relatively new program focused on an interdisciplinary approach to user experience and design. Through my studies I’ve developed skills in front-end development, graphic design, information architecture, interaction design, along with user research. Two things that ring true throughout my time thus far are an emphasis on accessibility and empathy. When designing and building something new, I’ve been taught to strive to make it work for everybody while focusing on what the user really wants our product to do for them.</p>

            <p>As I’ve continued my studies, I’ve discovered many different fields that I can jump into following my graduation in 2019. While my skill set covers all of these, I’m focusing my talents on user experience and interface design. I want to build the best tools for people to use that make them happy and have a desire to continue using them. I don’t want people to get tired of using the projects I work on; I want them to love coming back to them time and time again.</p>

            <p>Outside of my studies, I’m very much a geek. I love playing all of the amazing games Nintendo puts out, along with some spectacular RPGs on PlayStation. I often struggle to know what to play next, just because there are so many breathtaking games available. I also tend to watch too much television, particularly anime. And my boyfriend and I love getting out and playing Pokémon Go. Most of my time I’m either in the Green Bay or Chicago areas if I’m not at school.</p>

            <p>I’d love to work with you and if you’re looking for a creative, fun, team-player, let’s get in touch!</p>
