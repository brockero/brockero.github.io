            <h5 class="body-heading">Background</h5>
            <p>IDEAL is, as we call it, an “anti-anti-bullying” program. What we mean by this is there is much less of a focus on things like fighting, name-calling, and picking on others and instead a focus on inclusion, collaboration, friendship, and cooperation. IDEAL is a program designed for students in grades K-5 and features three tentpole parts: a book series, an interactive computer game, and what we call say something. Say something is a series of classroom activities that engage students to allow them to use the skills they learn through the books and game. <!--For more information about the ideation of the program, read part one of this case study <a href="ideal1">here</a>.--></p>

            <h5 class="body-heading">Phase 2 Goals</h5>
            <p>Coming into this phase, we had the product planned out, but were only working on ideas and very crude prototypes. This is because the first phase had no focus on design and was about learning and using the design thinking process. This time around was very different, though. Our mentor tasked us with accomplishing a small series of tasks over about three months. We were to:<p>
            <ul>
              <li>Develop a brand for the product</li>
              <li>Build a site map for a website</li>
              <li>Wireframe and mock-up the website home page</li>
              <li>Storyboard a book plot and interactive element for it</li>
              <li>Create some sample book spreads</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While it was a lot to take on and to iterate on as well, we were able to accomplish it. I will not be focusing on the website, as that was primarily my partner’s responsibility while I was working on the brand and the book. Here’s how it all went down!</p>

            <h5 class="body-heading">Visual Identity</h5>
            <p>My first task was to create an amount of branding for IDEAL. I was asked to create three different brand elements, as well as instructions for use of each:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Logos</li>
              <li>Color palette</li>
              <li>Type card</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Iteration</h6>
            <div class="center">
              <a href="../media/ideal/logos2.png" target="_blank"><img src="../media/ideal/logos2.png" class="type" alt="Various logo iterations"/></a>
              <a href="../media/ideal/logos3.png" target="_blank"><img src="../media/ideal/logos3.png" class="type" alt="More logo iterations"/></a>
              <div>Click to view images larger</div>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <p>While I started with a logo, it was very crude and didn’t really relate to the project that much. At first I tried to keep what we started with and build on that, but it quickly became clear that it wasn’t very original. What ended up happening was that initial logo was used to mess around with type and color choices to see what made sense for IDEAL. I remember going through around 20 different font and color options at this point before narrowing it down to a smaller number.</p>

            <p>Something else that resulted from it was an idea around a secondary logo I came up with. The open hands logo had a transparent background that could make it extremely hard to see its elements on almost any background. This would quickly become a problem as the logo would be applied to many different products. So I had a second logo that, at first was simply a triangle with the word mark inside of it, but this quickly evolved into something more. Here again, I played with the type until I eventually got to what was the final result.</p>

            <h6>Results and Rational</h6>
            <div class="center">
              <img src="../media/ideal/final-orange.png" class="logo" alt="Orange IDEAL main logo"/>
              <img src="../media/ideal/final-trio.png" class="logo" alt="Tri-color IDEAL logos"/>
            </div>
            <p>First, we’ll look at the final logo, which is actually four. The main logo for IDEAL is the orange triangle with our word mark inside of it. The triangle is used to represent the many places where threes appear throughout the project, first with the three parts of the project, book, game, and say something. The second is the three different age ranges it targets, grades K-1, 2-3, and 4-5. The triangle is an isosceles with the base facing to the right, which resembles a megaphone. This is to show that IDEAL encourages discussion, sharing, and openness. These ideas all together help to differentiate IDEAL from other anti-bullying programs. The corners of the triangle are rounded as we hope to create well-rounded individuals as they progress through from beginning to end.</p>

            <p>The other three logos, in red, blue, and green, are for each of the three phases of the project: book, game, and say something. These are intended to be used on packaging and materials for each of the phases. An example of this is shown below with the sample covers for the book.</p>

            <div class="center">
              <a href="../media/ideal/colors.png" target="_blank"><img src="../media/ideal/colors.png" class="type" alt="IDEAL brand color palette"/></a>
              <a href="../media/ideal/type.png" target="_blank"><img src="../media/ideal/type.png" class="type" alt="IDEAL type card"/></a>
              <div>Click to view images larger</div>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <p>We also have a color palette, focusing on orange, as well as the trio of red, blue, and green. These choices were made as IDEAL needs to have a light and fun appeal to kids, but also appear professional to teachers and administrators thinking about adopting the program for their classrooms and schools. The spectrum of grays is used as the neutral palette for the program to be used where necessary.</p>

            <p>Finally there are the typographical choices. Bungee Inline was chosen for the logo as the inline and its expansion represent growth of the students we intend to generate with IDEAL. Regarding the other type choice, we stuck with sans serif fonts, as they are generally friendlier and we want to keep that appeal throughout to help engage students.</p>

            <h5 class="body-heading">Book Goals</h5>
            <p>For the book, it was both a more simple project, but also much more complex. I had no experience with storyboarding or using InDesign for content creation. For the book, I had to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ideate a plot and (roughly) storyboard it</li>
              <li>Come up with and diagram an interactive element</li>
              <li>Design cover options and some sample spreads</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Book Storyboard and Interaction Design</h6>
            <div class="center">

            </div>
            <br/>
            <p>For our sample book, I targeted grades 2-3. These students would be taking their first steps into chapter books, something that is around 60-75 pages long and still includes a large number of illustrations. Being that I’m a user experience designer, the books needed to have an interactive element to them, which comes in the form of a guided choose-your-own-adventure novel. To accomplish this, students would be prompted at two key junctures to select various characters they wanted our lead, Ken, to interact with. The students would choose two characters twice throughout the story, while also being guided to the “correct” plot points to guide our story themes. In this way, each student may experience the story slightly differently, but they all ultimately come to the same outcome. By doing this, we keep the book easily teachable and adaptable based on the types of students.</p>

            <h6>Book Graphic Design</h6>
            <div class="center">

            <br/>
            <p>Up to this point, my design work has been primarily in the digital space. To design the spreads, I had my first taste of using Adobe InDesign. While similar to the other Adobe products I’ve used in the past, such as Illustrator and XD, it had a bit of a learning curve as I was trying to design. I did a fair bit of research as I was going along to find the tools I needed to accomplish what I set out to do. I haven't used InDesign much following the completion of this project, but the techniques and design ideas have become a standard part of my toolkit since.</p>

            <p>Regarding the design itself, I wanted something very colorful and friendly, where appropriate, to keep young readers interested and engaged. For the pages that are not text heavy, I used a colorful orange background, where the illustrations popped off the page. Using a comic style design, speech bubbles were added to make the characters feel more alive than if their lines were spoken through standard paragraphs. The chapters themselves feature colored bars on the edges of each page. This allows the reader to quickly orient themselves with where they are. It also provides a secondary way to guide them through the book, especially when it comes to the interaction, where they are jumping from one section to another. Providing both textual and graphical representations of the interactive jumps was important as an accommodation tool for young, developing readers. Many of the stylistic choices were adopted from various other children’s chapter books with the IDEAL brand applied on top of it.</p>

            <h5 class="body-heading">Outcomes</h5>
            <p>This was a very fun project to work on. I had my first experience designing a brand and working with InDesign on a project as well. While I haven’t used it since, it is still good experience to have under my belt, for whenever it comes up. I would have liked to bring some of these ideas to test, but we weren’t able to get it in front of students within our timeline. And while it hasn’t had any work done on it since, maybe one day I’ll come back to it.
