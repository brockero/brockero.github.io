            <h5 class="body-heading">Background and Goals</h5>
            <p class="body-content">The Michigan State University Museum is the natural history museum operated and maintained on campus. The Museum itself is free and open to the public, but they host numerous paid events throughout the year. Card sorting is a common technique used to discover a user’s mental visualization of a space, both virtual and physical. It involves representing content and information on individual cards and having participants group them in ways that are meaningful to them. I was tasked with analyzing a series of card sorts that were completed by one of the Experience Architecture classes so as to provide some additional analysis and improvement suggestions to the MSU Museum’s technology staff.<p>
            <p><span class="body-content">This project had three main goals:
              <ul>
                <li>To complete a deeper analysis of the card sorts completed in AL 333 (Researching User Experience)</li>
                <li>To learn what was discovered in each study and find common threads among them</li>
                <li>To provide short- and long-term suggestions to the MSU Museum</li>
              </ul>
            </p></span>
            <h5 class="body-heading">Data Collection</h5>
            <p>For this study, the data from 13 different card sorts was compiled into one superset. The card sorts were originally completed on or around October 19th, 2016 by the members of AL 333. Each group used a different set of cards, as determined by the individual groups. While generally it would be good to have a consistent set of cards, there are two important notes to consider. The first is that the class assignment was designed to be the students’ first foray into card sorts. Second, my role was to see if, even though these were different sets, there are any threads that can come out of them.</p>
            <p>For the sake of consistency, I developed a consistent spreadsheet layout to categorize and sort each piece of data. During compilation, I chose to duplicate the final spreadsheet to allow for two ways to easily sort the data. One spreadsheet has each group’s result sorted by card name and the other has each group’s result sorted by the category names developed during the study. I also needed to split the card sorts into two different groups, ones completed around the Museum’s website and ones completed about the physical space at the Museum. Doing this allowed me to look into each use case for the information available.</p>
            <p>A final note is that these card sorts were not necessarily designed around a particular subsection of the website or one exhibit. Many of them bounced around and had cards from all over the website or all over the museum. This is because the class assignment only required 30 cards. In a more thorough project, it would be important to determine the focus and work within that constraint.</p>
            <h5 class="body-heading">Data Analysis</h5>
            <p>First, the card sorts related to the website. A common thread is that there are a lot of different pages currently on the website and that the best way, without removing any of them, is to group them into a large number of categories. Two large issues that came up through this are that many pages had very little content on them and that these large number of categories ended up with few pages. I suggested looking for ways to combine like content onto a page to minimize the number of pages across the entire website.</p>
            <p>Second, the card sorts based on the physical space. Three groups chose to focus on the physical space and the exhibition pieces on show at the Museum. Each of these groups chose different exhibits, locations, and artifacts on show. When they were sorted, generally the same groups appeared in each: ecology/animals, culture and sociology, history, science, and visitor needs. There is not much that can be done with these without considering the current exhibit placement and the layout of the Museum, but it is promising to see that the many like things were grouped together by both card sort participants and present location in the Museum.</p>
            <h5 class="body-heading">Results and Considerations for Next Time</h5>
            <p>At the end of the project, I presented my work to two faculty of the MSU Museum as well as my professor. I also provided the staff with a full report, including suggested steps, and the data sets that were generated. Generally what I discovered was that the content they had was good, it just needed to be reorganized and redesigned to make the website a better place for a potential visitor, student, or faculty member to visit. </p>
            <p>Looking back at this project, it certainly is an unusual research project, as it has a variety of different sets of data coming together to try and produce some findings. One thing I would consider is standardizing the names of the cards across the data. For example, if one set has a card “Contact,” another has “Contact Info,” and a third has “Contact Us,” I could change those to all be simply “Contact.” This would make it easier to see connections across the various card sorts that were completed. It would be extremely important to keep the original card names with the sets because those names are what had been sorted and it’s important to not alter the data. In a more thorough study, this would not be an issue as the card sets would all have been the same from the beginning.</p>
